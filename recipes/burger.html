    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Nothing says summer quite like a juicy grilled 
        burger. You'll find the full recipe below with 
        step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can 
        expect when you make these top-rated burger patties:
    </p>
    <p>
        Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together 
        in a large bowl. Then, add the ground beef and bread 
        crumbs before forming the mixture into ¾-inch patties. Place the patties on a preheated grill and cook for six to eight minutes per side.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 
        degrees F before serving, and you're ready to go. 
        Top with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, 
        and mayo for full-fledged flavor.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 large egg
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            1 pound ground beef
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup fine dry bread crumbs
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for 
            high heat and lightly oil grate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with 
            your hands or a fork until well blended.
        </li>
        <li>
            Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and 
            cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired 
            doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted 
            into the center should read at least 160 degrees 
            F (70 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve hot and enjoy!
